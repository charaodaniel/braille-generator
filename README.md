## Known Issues

- I'm currently using the Apple Braille font. I think there's probably a better way to do this to make it for transferrable. Maybe using unicode, not sure.

## Why?

In my other life, I create digital artwork (like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Brne-SzBkHq/)) with various apps on my iPhone. I wanted a quick way to add the title of the artwork using braille code to give it a more interesting look.
